**`SoundCloud`** is a Swift Package that implements the [SoundCloud Public API Specification (v1.0.0) ](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/open-api). 

It handles the logic for authenticating with a SoundCloud account using the OAuth 2.1 standard, **including PKCE**, and provides an API for streaming audio and accessing track, artist, and playlist data from SoundCloud.

## Installation
`SoundCloud` is available via the Swift Package Manager. Copy the repo link into the search bar:

## Setup
[Define a custom URL scheme for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app), you will need to provide a redirect URI using the scheme so that the OAuth web page knows how to open your app when it receives the tokens callback:

The redirect URI used when creating the `SoundCloud` instance must also be paired with the client ID and client secret for your [SoundCloud registered app](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps).

## Usage
To login using a SoundCloud account:

```swift
import SoundCloud

let config = SoundCloudConfig(clientId: ...)
@StateObject var sc = SoundCloud(config)  
  
...  

    
do {
    try await sc.login()
} catch {
    // Handle login error
}

```

To get the liked tracks for the authenticated user:

```swift
let likedTracks = try await sc.getMyLikedTracks()
```

## Example apps
This package is used by the third-party SoundCloud watchOS app **WatchCloud**, check it out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watchcloud/id6466678799) ðŸ“²
